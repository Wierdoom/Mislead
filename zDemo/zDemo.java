Io.out("But it seems like they've been pouring a lot of effort into hushing it up. If the place ends up protected, they'll lose prime logging land.");
Io.out("So you're trespassing. If you can bring evidence back - serious handheld evidence - of the value of this place, UNESCO will come booming in and ZexCo will get booted out.");
